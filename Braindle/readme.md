html files are in templates folder

assets/ has all the css and fonts

ignore homepage, noxen and pendrop folders, its some python code i needed when i initially coded 

static is kind of where VS accesses all the css and images from in the code

manage.py is the django part

i think you can wrap it around npm also, and detangle it from django
